        <h1 class="h1--show">Remove A Property</h1>

        <p>In order to remove a property from the application, go to the <a href="/landlord/update-room-availability">Update room availability</a> page and ensure the room is switched to unavailable. This will remove the property from the application's listings.</p>
        <p>By hiding a property in this manner, it means that re-adding the property to the application the following year is quick and easy.</p>
        <p>If you would like to completely remove your property from Student Rooma, please contact <a href="mailto:support@studentrooma.co.uk">support@studentrooma.co.uk</a>.</p>
